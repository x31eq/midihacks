Code here should work for retuning a MIDI keyboard
to 29-note equal temperament.

Instructions:

1. Find a MIDI UART adapter for the micro:bit

2. Connect MIDI in to pin 0 and MIDI out to pin 1

3. Flash "midibit.py" to the micro:bit (e.g. uflash midibit.py /media/sdb)

4. Copy "midi.py" and "retune.py" over (e.g. ufs put midi.py; ufs put retune.py)

5. Reset the micro:bit

6. Press button A (the one on the left)

7. This should be relaying and retuning now

8. Press button A again to get the serial terminal back
